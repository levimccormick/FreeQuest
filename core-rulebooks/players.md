# Playing the game

One player is the referee. Their job is to reveal the quest and control the monsters. The rest of the players control heroes. Players take turns completing their actions, trying to complete the objective of the quest.

# Resolving Actions

### Static Tests

A static test involves rolling a stat against a set target number. Each die that equals or exceeds the target number is a success. Disarming a trap or leaping over obstacles use a Test to resolve.

### Contests

A contest is a roll between two stats. Attacks, some spells, and other actions use a Contest to resolve. Each side rolls a number of dice equal to their stat. They compare each dice pool and discard duplicate dice on a one-for-one basis. The defender's highest die becomes the target of the attacker. Each attacking die equal to or higher than the target becomes a success.

# Creating a Hero

Choose one of the supplied heroes. Transfer the values to your hero record sheet. The hero may have some selections to complete when creating the hero. These will be listed in the hero's definition. Record these choices on the record sheet, as well.

# On A Player's Turn

A hero may perform any two actions once per turn. The actions are Move, Attack, Cast a Spell, Search, or Activate the Terrain. Actions can be done in any order, but cannot be split. A hero may not Move, Attack, and then finish moving.

### Movement

A hero may move a number of spaces up to their movement rate indicated on their character card. Heroes may move through allies, but cannot share a space with them. Heroes may not move diagonally, past monsters, or through furniture. Opening a door does not count as an action, therefore it does not count as splitting movement. A hero may move up to a closed door, open it, and then move through it on the same action.

#### Jumping

A character can jump over terrain obstacles. Character can attempt to leap over furniture or traps. To leap, the character must have enough movement to complete the jump and roll their Skill dice. The target is 4. For each success, the hero can leap one square. If there aren't enough successes to complete the movement, the hero ends their movement next to the obstacle. If the hero is attempting to leap a trap, they trigger the trap and movement ends.

### Attack

A hero may attack any enemy that it is **adjacent** to. Heroes may not attack diagonally. To make an attack, the hero rolls a number of dice equal to the attack value. The defending enemy rolls the number of dice their defense value. Compare the dice pools. Each pool discards duplicates on a one-for-one basis. The defender's highest remaining die becomes the target of the attacker. Count all the attacker's dice that equal or exceed the target number. This is the damage the enemy suffers. If no dice exceed the roll, the attack fails. If no dice remain for the defender, count all the attacker's dice as damage.

>The barbarian attacks a goblin using his battle axe (4). He rolls 4,3,3,1. The goblin rolls his defense (2): 4,2. Each combatant discards a 4. The defender is left with a 2, making that the target for the attack. The two 3s count as 2 damage to the goblin.

>The ranger shoots a troll with his longbow (3): 5,5,3. The troll rolls his defense (4): 5,4,4,3. Comparing the pools, they each discard a 5. The troll's highest die, a 4, becomes the target number. The ranger has one 5 left over, dealing one damage to the troll.

#### Ranged Attacks

Weapons with the *ranged* property allow heroes to attack any monster that isn't **adjacent** and is within **line of sight**. Same attack resolution mechanics apply.

### Cast a Spell

Heroes with spell casting ability can use this action. The caster must have **line of sight** to the target. Refer to the spell definition to resolve its effects. Once the spell has been cast, mark off/discard the spell card. Spells can be used only once per quest, unless otherwise noted in the spell or hero definition.

### Search

Heroes can search a room or hallway for treasure, traps, or secret doors. A hero can only search for one thing per action. When searching for traps or secret doors, the game controller will reveal all of the traps or secret doors in the room or hallway the hero occupies. When searching for treasure, the game controller will award any treasure in the room to the hero. If the room does not contain treasure, a random treasure is drawn from the deck. Watch out for Wandering Monsters.

### Activate the Terrain

Activating terrain encompasses any kind of interaction with the terrain, whether it's disarming a trap or manipulating a device. Refer to the quest text for the rules of interacting with a device.

#### Disarming a trap

To disarm a trap, the hero announces they are attempting to disarm the trap and the moves into the square. The hero then makes a Skill test against a target of 5. A success means the trap is permanently disarmed. If the hero rolls a 1 on any dice without rolling a success, the trap is triggered and the hero suffers the full effect.

# Spells

Spellcasting players take turn selecting spells from those available, no duplicates. Some spells allow the monster to attempt to resist the effect. They make a Skill contest vs the spell caster's Magic dice.

> The wizard casts Imolate on a mummy. The mummy makes a Skill (3) contest against the Wizard's magic (5): [5, 4, 2] vs [5, 3, 3, 2, 2]. They each discard a 5 and a 2, leaving the mummy with a 4 exceeding the wizard's high result of 3. The mummy takes one damage.

### Attack Spells

**Flame Burst**
Attack any monster you can see with 4 Attack dice.

**Imolate**
Any monster you can see takes 2 damage. The monster reduces the damage by one per success in a Skill vs Magic Contest.

### Healing

**Healing Water**
Restore 5 health to an adjacent hero. A hero cannot exceed their maximum health.



### Buff/Debuff

**Burning Rage**
Any hero gains Attack +2, Defense -2 and does not die when reduced to zero health. This spell lasts until they can no longer see any monsters. If the hero's health is at zero at the end of this spell, they will die.

### Movement

# Enchanted Items
[Here or separate?]

# Dying Heroes

When a hero is reduced to zero health, they are dead. Remove their figure from the board and mark the location with a dead hero tile. Another hero can retrieve the hero's equipment or body by entering the square. A hero carrying a dead hero can only move at half speed and cannot make attacks or jump. Equipment or heroes not retrieved by the end of the quest are lost forever.

If all the heroes die, the quest is failed. The referee will determine the results of a failed quest.

# Completing A Quest

Each quest will have a specific objective, such as retrieving an item or killing a specific monster. The quest is considered complete if the objective is completed and all the heroes return to the starting tile. Surviving heroes are returned to their maximum health.

# Between Quests

There are a few things that can be done between quests. Heroes can spend gold on upgrading their equipment. Then can also learn new abilities or improve their existing ones.

### Going Shopping

To upgrade equipment, refer to the equipment chart for prices and values. Deduct the price and record the equipment on your record sheet. Old equipment can be sold back at half price (round down).

### Improve Your Heroes

Heroes can improve their abilities through completing quests. Each hero's requirements for improvement are defined on their sheets.

### Raise the dead

Dead heroes rescued from the dungeon have a chance to be brought back.
