# Playing the game

One player is the referee. Their job is to reveal the quest and control the monsters. The rest of the players control heroes. Players take turns completing their actions, trying to complete the objective of the quest.

# Creating a Hero

Choose one of the supplied heroes. Transfer the values to your hero record sheet. The hero may have some selections to complete when creating the hero. These will be listed in the hero's definition. Record these choices on the record sheet, as well.

# On A Player's Turn

A hero may perform any two actions once per turn. The actions are Move, Attack, Cast a Spell, Search, or Activate the Terrain. Actions can be done in any order, but cannot be split. A hero may not Move, Attack, and then finish moving.

## Movement

A hero may move a number of spaces up to their movement rate indicated on their character card. Heroes may move through allies, but cannot share a space with them. Heroes may not move diagonally, past monsters, or through furniture. Opening a door does not count as an action, therefore it does not count as splitting movement. A hero may move up to a closed door, open it, and then move through it on the same action.

### Jumping

A character can jump over terrain obstacles. Character can attempt to leap over furniture or traps. To leap, the character must have enough movement to complete the jump and roll their Skill dice. The target is 4. For each success, the hero can leap one square. If there aren't enough successes to complete the movement, the hero ends their movement next to the obstacle. If the hero is attempting to leap a trap, they trigger the trap and movement ends.

## Attack

A hero may attack any enemy that it is **adjacent** to. Heroes may not attack diagonally. To make an attack, the hero rolls a number of dice equal to the attack value. The defending enemy rolls the number of dice their defense value. Compare the dice pools. Each pool discards duplicates on a one-for-one basis. The defender's highest remaining die becomes the target of the attacker. Count all the attacker's dice that equal or exceed the target number. This is the damage the enemy suffers. If no dice exceed the roll, the attack fails. If no dice remain for the defender, count all the attacker's dice as damage.

>The barbarian attacks a goblin using his battle axe (4). He rolls 4,3,3,1. The goblin rolls his defense (2): 4,2. Each combatant discards a 4. The defender is left with a 2, making that the target for the attack. The two 3s count as 2 damage to the goblin.

>The ranger shoots a troll with his longbow (3): 5,5,3. The troll rolls his defense (4): 5,4,4,3. Comparing the pools, they each discard a 5. The troll's highest die, a 4, becomes the target number. The ranger has one 5 left over, dealing one damage to the troll.

### Ranged Attacks

Weapons with the *ranged* property allow heroes to attack any monster that isn't **adjacent** and is within **line of sight**. Same attack resolution mechanics apply.

## Cast a Spell

Heroes with spell casting ability can use this action. The caster must have **line of sight** to the target. Refer to the spell definition to resolve its effects. Once the spell has been cast, mark off/discard the spell card. Spells can be used only once.

## Search

Heroes can search a room or hallway for treasure, traps, or secret doors. A hero can only search for one thing per action. When searching for traps or secret doors, the game controller will reveal all of the traps or secret doors in the room or hallway the hero occupies. When searching for treasure, the game controller will award any treasure in the room to the hero. If the room does not contain treasure, a random treasure is drawn from the deck. Watch out for Wandering Monsters.

## Activate the Terrain

Activating terrain encompasses any kind of interaction with the terrain, whether it's disarming a trap or manipulating a device. Refer to the quest text for the rules of interacting with a device.

### Disarming a trap

To disarm a trap, the hero announces they are attempting to disarm the trap and the moves into the square. The hero then rolls their Skill dice, with a target of 5. A success means the trap is permanently disarmed. If the hero rolls a 1 on any dice without rolling a success, the trap is triggered and the hero suffers the full effect.

# Dying Heroes

When a hero is reduced to zero health, they are dead. Remove their figure from the board and mark the location with a dead hero tile. Another hero can retrieve the hero's equipment or body by enter the square. A hero carrying a dead hero can only move at half speed and cannot make attacks.

# Between Quests

There are a few things that can be done between quests. Heroes can spend gold on upgrading their equipment. Then can also learn new abilities or improve their existing ones.

## Going Shopping

To upgrade equipment, refer to the equipment chart for prices and values. Deduct the price and record the equipment on your record sheet. Old equipment can be sold back at half price (round down).

## Improve Your Heroes

Heroes can improve their abilities through completing quests. Each hero's requirements for improvement are defined on their sheets.

## Raise the dead

Dead heroes rescued from the dungeon have a chance to be brought back.
