# On the referee's Turn

Once each player has their turn performing actions, the referee takes a turn for each monster on the board. Like heroes, monsters can perform two unique actions on their turn. Their actions are limited to: Move, Attack, Cast a Spell (if they have any).

## Movement

Each monster can move a number of spaces up to their movement. They can move over each other, but cannot end movement in a square occupied by another monster. They cannot move over heroes or furniture. Monsters do not open doors or trigger traps by their movement.

## Attack

A monster may attack any hero that it is **adjacent** to. Monsters may not attack diagonally. To make an attack, the monster rolls a number of dice equal to the attack value. The defending hero rolls the number of dice their defense value. Compare the rolls by first discarding duplicates between the totals. The defender's highest roll becomes the target of the attacker. Sum up all dice that equal or exceed the target number. This is the damage the hero suffers. If no dice exceed the roll, the attack fails. If no dice remain for the defender, sum up all the attacker's dice as damage.

>An orc attacks the wizard. The referee rolls 3 attack dice: 5,3,2. The hero rolls 2 defense dice: 5,3. They discard the duplicate 5 dice. The defense number is three, so the wizard takes 3 damage.

## Cast a Spell

Monsters with spell casting ability can use this action. The caster must have **line of sight** to the target. Refer to the spell definition to resolve its effects. Once the spell has been cast, mark off/discard the spell card. Spells can be used only once.
