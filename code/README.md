# FreeQuest Tests

I wrote this code to help simulate the dice mechanics of the game. These simulations are intended to assist when balancing all the numbers in regards to hero abilities, weapons, monsters, etc. This will be handled similar to open source software projects. Before new submissions are accepted, tests will be run to evaluate the balance.

This is still a work in progress.
