# FreeQuest
FreeQuest is an open source fantasy adventure board game inspired by games like Heroquest, Warhammer Quest, and Descent. It aims to recreate the feeling of an adventure board game with simple mechanics that anyone with a printer can produce in their home. Adaptations will allow for use of models or terrain.

While we playtest the system, we won't be accepting external contributions. Once we solidify the design, we'll be looking for artwork, tokens, models, heroes, monsters, quests, etc.
